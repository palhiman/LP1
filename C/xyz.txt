Basic probability rules and models

Probability gives the information about how likely an event can occur. Digging into the terminology of the probability: 

Trial or Experiment: The act that leads to a result with certain possibility.
Sample space: The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment.
Event: Non empty subset of sample space is known as event.

So in technical terms, probability is the measure of how likely an event is when an experiment is conducted.
