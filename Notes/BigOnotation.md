# Big O notation
__________________

+ a.k.a. Asymptotic Analysis
+ used to compare efficiency of different approaches to same problems.
+ It is basically used compare different algorithms
+ It tells how long an algorithm takes to run
+ Big O notation express the runtime as "how quickly it grows relatively to the input, as the input gets arbitrarily large."
+ O(1) - constant time
+ O(n) - linear time
+ O(n^2) - quadratic time
+ We should make right balance between runtime,space, implementation,time, maintainability and readability.
